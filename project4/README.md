# Distributed File System

In this assignment, you will be developing a working distributed file
server. We provide you with only the `gunrock_web` HTTP framework; you
have to build the rest.

The goals of this project are:
- To learn the basics of on-disk structures for file systems
- To learn about file system internals
- To learn about distributed storage systems

This project consists of three main parts: [reading on-disk storage using command line utilities](#file-system-utilities),
a [local file system](#local-file-system), and using the local file system to impelemnt a [distributed
file system](#distributed-file-system-1). We recommend implementing your server in this order where you ensure that you have
a solid foundation before moving on to the next part.

Fundamentally, this project is all about persistent storage. However, the
interfaces you have to work with are all different. The disk operates only
on disk blocks, the local file system organizes disk blocks into a heirarchical
file system, and the API layer uses the local file system to provide an object
abstraction. Each of these components have their own unique physical reality
to work with and illusion they provide to software running above.

## Distributed File System

### Background
The main idea behind a distribute file system is that you can have
multiple clients access the same file system at the same time. One
popular distributed file system, which serves as inspiration for this
project, is Amazon's S3 storage system. S3 is used widely and provides
clear semantics with a simple REST/HTTP API for accessing data. With
these basics in place, S3 provides the storage layer that powers many
of the modern apps we all use every day.

Like local file systems, distributed file systems support a number of
high level file system operations. In this project you'll implement
`read()`, `write()`, and `delete()` operations on objects using
HTTP APIs.

### HTTP/REST API

In your distributed file system you will have two different entities:
`files` and `directories`. You will access these entities using
standard HTTP/REST network calls. All URL paths begin with `/ds3/`,
which defines the root of your file system.

To create or update a file, use HTTP `PUT` method where the URL
defines the file name and path and the body of your PUT request
contains the entire contents of the file. If the file already exists,
the PUT call overwrites the contents with the new data sent via the
body.

In the system, directories are created implicitly. If a client PUTs a
file located at `/ds3/a/b/c.txt` and directories `a` and `b` do not
already exist, you will create them as a part of handling the
request. If one of the directories on the path exists as a file
already, like `/a/b`, then it is an error.

To read a file, you use the HTTP `GET` method, specifying the file
location as the path of your URL and your server will return the
contents of the file as the body in the response. To read a directory,
you also use the HTTP `GET` method, but directories list the entries
in a directory.  To encode directory entries, you put each directory
entry on a new line and regular files are listed directly, and
directories are listed with a trailing "/". For `GET` on a directory
omit the entries for `.` and `..`. For example, `GET` on `/ds3/a/b` will
return:

`c.txt`

And `GET` on `/ds3/a/` will return:

`b/`

The listed entries should be sorted using standard string comparison
sorting functions.

To delete a file, you use the HTTP `DELETE` method, specifying the
file location as the path of your URL. To delete a directory, you also
use `DELETE` but deleting a directory that is not empty it
is an error.

You will implement your API handlers in [DistributedFileSystemService.cpp](gunrock_web/DistributedFileSystemService.cpp).

Since Gunrock is a HTTP server, you can use command line utilities,
like cURL to help test it out. Here are a few example cURL command:

```bash
% curl -X PUT -d "file contents" http://localhost:8080/ds3/a/b/c.txt 
% curl http://localhost:8080/ds3/a/b/c.txt                          
file contents
% curl http://localhost:8080/ds3/a/b/     
c.txt
% curl http://localhost:8080/ds3/a/b 
c.txt
% curl http://localhost:8080/ds3/a  
b/
% curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/ds3/a/b/c.txt
% curl http://localhost:8080/ds3/a/b/               
% 
```

### Dealing with errors
To implement your distributed storage interface, you will use a sequence of LocalFileSystem calls.
Although each of these calls individually will ensure that they will not modify the disk when
they have an error, since your implementation uses several LocalFileSystem calls it needs to
clean up when something goes wrong. The key principle is that if an API call has an error, there
should not be any changes to the underlying disk or local file system.

To clean up the LocalFileSystem on errors, you can use the [Disk](gunrock_web/include/Disk.h) interface for transactions.
To use transactions, when you know that a file system call can change the disk's state, then
start a transaction by calling `beginTransaction`. As your implementation for an API call
proceeds, if the call is successful then you can `commit` your transaction to ensure that
all file system modifications persist. If the call ends with an error, you can call `rollback`
to reverse any writes that happened before the error.

There are four types of errors that your distributed file system can return. First, use
`ClientError::notFound()` for any API calls that try to access a resouce that does not
exist. Second, use `ClientError::insufficientStorage()` for operations that modify the file system
and need to allocate new blocks but the disk does not have enough storage to satisfy them.
Third, use `ClientError::conflict()` if an API call tries to create a directory in a location
where a file already exists. Fourth, use `ClientError::badRequest()` for all other errors.

To return an error to the client, in your `DistributedFileSystemService.cpp` file, throw an
exception using the [ClientError](gunrock_web/include/ClientError.h) exception class, and the
gunrock web framework will catch these errors and convert them to the right HTTP response and status
code for that error.

## Local file system
### On-Disk File System: A Basic Unix File System

The on-disk file system structures follow that of the
very simple file system discussed
[here](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/file-implementation.pdf). On-disk,
the structures are as follows:
- A single block (4KB) super block
- An inode bitmap (can be one or more 4KB blocks, depending on the number of inodes)
- A data bitmap (can be one or more 4KB blocks, depending on the number of data blocks)
- The inode table (a multiple of 4KB-sized blocks, depending on the number of inodes)
- The data region (some number of 4KB blocks, depending on the number of data blocks)

More details about on-disk structures can be found in the header
[ufs.h](ufs.h), which you should use. Specifically, this has a very
specific format for the super block, inode, and directory
entries. Bitmaps just have one bit per allocated unit as described in
the book.

As for directories, here is a little more detail.  Each directory has
an inode, and points to one or more data blocks that contain directory
entries. Each directory entry should be simple, and consist of 32
bytes: a name and an inode number pair. The name should be a
fixed-length field of size 28 bytes; the inode number is just an
integer (4 bytes). When a directory is created, it should contain two
entries: the name `.` (dot), which refers to this new directory's
inode number, and `..` (dot-dot), which refers to the parent
directory's inode number. For the root directory in a file system,
both `.` and `..` refer to the root directory.

When your server is started, it is passed the name of the file system
image file. The image is created by a tool we provide, called `mkfs`.
It is pretty self-explanatory and can be found
[here](mkfs.c).

When accessing the files on an image, your server should read in the
superblock, bitmaps, and inode table from disk as needed. When writing
to the image, you should update these on-disk structures accordingly.

One important aspect of your on-disk structure is that you need to
assume that your server can crash at any time, so all disk writes need
to leave your file system in a consistent state. To maintain
consistency you'll need to order your writes carefully to make sure
that if your system crashes your file system is always correct.

Importantly, you cannot change the file-system on-disk format.

For more detailed documentation on the local file system specification,
please see [LocalFileSystem.h](gunrock_web/include/LocalFileSystem.h)
and the stub [LocalFileSystem.cpp](gunrock_web/LocalFileSystem.cpp). Also,
please see [Disk.h](gunrock_web/Disk.h) for the interface for accessing
the disk.

### Bitmaps for block allocation
We use on-disk bitmaps to keep track of entries (inodes and data blocks) that
the file system has allocated. For our bitmaps for each byte, the least
significant bit (LSB) is considered the first bit, and the most significant
bit (MSB) is considered the last bit. So if the first bit of a two byte
bitmap is set, it will look like this in hex:

```
byte position:  0  1
hex value:     01 00

bit position   0                               15
bit value:     1 0 0 0  0 0 0 0  0 0 0 0  0 0 0 0
```

and if the last bit is set it will look like this in hex:

```
byte position:  0  1
hex value:     00 80

bit position   0                               15
bit value:     0 0 0 0  0 0 0 0  0 0 0 0  0 0 0 1
```

### LocalFileSystem `write` and `read` semantics
In our file system, we don't have a notion of appending or modifying data.
Conceptually, when we get a `write` call we overwrite the entire contents
of the file with the new contents of the file, and write calls specify
the complete contents of the file.

Calls to `read` always read data starting from the beginning of the file,
but if the caller specifies a size of less than the size of the object
then you should return only these bytes. If the caller specifies a size
of larger than the size of the object, then you only return the bytes
in the object.

### LocalFileSystem out of storage errors
One important class of errors that your `LocalFileSystem` needs to handle is
out of storage errors. Out of storage errors can happen when one of the
file system modification calls -- `create`, `write`, and `unlink` -- does not
have enough availabe storage to complete the request. You should identify
out of storage errors before making any writes to disk. So in other words,
your file system should be unchanged if an out of storage error happens.

## File system utilities
To help debug your disk images, you will create three small command-line utilities
that read information about a given disk image and write it out to the command line.
We have included an example disk image and expected outputs in the [disk_testing](gunrock_web/disk_testing)
directory, but make sure that your utilities can handle multiple different disk
image configurations and contents.

To implement your file system utilities, you'll want to have implementaitons
for read-only functions within `LocalFileSystem.cpp` and use these functions
to implement the utilities. In particular, you should implement `stat` and
`read` to implement `ds3ls` and `ds3cat` (remember, the root directory is
always inode 0 in our file system). For `ds3bits` you'll want to implement
`readSuperBlock`, `readInodeBitmap`, and `readDataBitmap`.

Our hope is that with these utilities you can ensure that your read-only 
functions work and you can use these utilities to help debug as you implement
more functionality.

Note: We will only test your utilities on correct disk images -- you can assume
that all data on disk in the test cases is consistent and correct.

### The `ds3ls` utility
The `ds3ls` utility prints the names for all of the files and directories in
a disk image. This utility takes a single command line argument: the name of
the disk image file to use. This program will start at the root of the file system, print
the contents of that directory in full, and then traverse to each directory
contained within. This process repeats in a depth-first fasion until all
file and directory names have been printed.

When printing the contents of a directory, first, print the word `Directory`
followed by a space and then the full path for the directory you're printing,
and ending it with a newline. Second, print each of the entries in that 
directory. Sorted each entry using `std::strcmp` and print them in that order.
Each entry will include the inode number, a tab, the name of the entry, and
finishing it off with a newline. Third, print a empty line consisting of only
a newline to finish printing the contents of the directory.

Make sure that your solution does _not_ print the contents of `.` and `..`
subdirectories as this action would lead to an infinitely loop.

After printing a directory, traverse into each subdirectory and repeat the process
recursively in a depth-first fashion.

### The `ds3cat` utility
The `ds3cat` utility prints the contents of a file to standard output. It takes
the name of the disk image file and an inode number as the only arguments. It prints the contents of the file
that is specified by the inode number.

For this utility, first print the string `File blocks` with a newline at the end
and then print each of the disk block numbers for the file to standard out, one
disk block number per line. After printing the file blocks, print an empty line
with only a newline.

Next, print the string `File data` with a newline at the end and then print
the full contents of the file to standard out. You do not need to differentiate
between files and directories, for this utility everything is considered to be
data and should be printed to standard out.

### The `ds3bits` utility
The `ds3bits` utility prints metadata for the file system on a disk image. It takes
a single command line argument: the name of a disk image file.

First, it prints metadata about the file system starting with the string `Super` on a
line, then `inode_region_addr` followed by a space and then the inode region address from
the super block. Next, it should print the string `data_region_addr` followed by a space and the
data region address from the super block, followed by a newline. Finally, print an empty line
with just a newline character.

Next it prints the inode and data bitmaps. Each bitmap starts with a string on its own line,
`Inode bitmap` and `Data bitmap` respectively. For each bitmap, print the byte value,
formatted as an `unsigned int` followed by a space. For each byte in your bitmap your print
statement might look something like this:

```
cout << (unsigned int) bitmap[idx] << " ";
```

Where each byte is followed by a space, including the last byte and after you're done printing
all of the bytes print a single newline character.

Print the indoe bitmap first, followed by blank line consisting of only a single
newline character, then print the data bitmap.

## Gradescope
We are using Gradescope to autograde your projects. You should submit the following
files to Gradescope: `LocalFileSystem.cpp`, `DistributedFileSystemService.cpp`,
`ds3ls.cpp`, `ds3cat.cpp`, and `ds3bits.cpp`. The autograder requires all files to run
so we provided stubs for each of these that you can use until you have your own 
implementation of them.
